# STExtension-Snapshot
Takes a snapshot of the current chat and makes an image of it for easy sharing.
All styling is respected, and the width of the messages is decided by your chat width, for narrower/longer message blocks in the resulting image, turn up or down your chat width!

### Issues?
- Biggest issues arise from having CORS policy set to strict.
- Outdated ST. The extension relies on having SillyTavern 1.12.0 or newer, please update if you're having issues.
- **Still not resolved? Reach out; [Zennou.dev](https://zennou.dev/index.html?p=1) or open an issue.**
